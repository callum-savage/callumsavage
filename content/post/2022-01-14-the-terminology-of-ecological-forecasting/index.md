The language of ecological forecasting is a bit of a mess.

As an emerging field of study, it’s understandable that the terminology is still a little loose. H

There is a great deal of confusion in the ecological forecasting literature about the use of the terms ‘forecasting’ and ‘prediction’. In some articles the terms are used quite loosely, simply to mean ‘a statement about the future’. Other times, they have quite specific definitions.

As a newcomer to the field of ecological forecasting, I’ve found these shifting definitions to be a cause of great confusion. Not only can it make reading a paper more difficult, but also when comparing between papers I’ve found I need to be vigilant in confirming that the language is being used in the same way. One paper’s ‘ecological forecast’ might be another’s ‘environmental simulation’.

This has been particularly troubling in my current attempts to write a review article. How do you review a field when you can’t even find it’s research?

As ecological forecasting is a relatively young field, I think this inconsistent terminology has more impact than simply confusing novice students like me. It serves to create an additional layer of disconnect between authors. How much harder is it to find an article when you don’t know what the key words are?

The good news is, that with one or two notable exceptions, this confusion can be unraveled. By looking at the language used in key ecological forecasting papers, as well as other forecasting domains, we can find a set of definitions which enable effective communication without loss of specificity.

## So what’s a forecast then?

The [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](https://ecoforecast.org/about/) defines ecological forecasting as

> “…the process of predicting the state of ecosystems, ecosystem services, and natural capital, with fully specified uncertainties, and is contingent on explicit scenarios of climate, land use, human population, technologies, and economic activity.” (Clark, 2001)

There’s a few important things to note about this definition. Firstly, *forecasting is not specifically a statement about the future*. A forecast might also be focused on extending results to another physical area, or looking at an unmeasured variable in a the same area. Secondly, *forecasts require uncertainties*. A lot of journal articles will use the term ‘forecast’ without making any explicit predictions, and if they do have predictions, they will often lack the error bounds required for them to be useful. And thirdly, *a forecast can be based on a scenario.* That is to say, a forecast can be based on a situation which, of itself, may be quite unlikely.

While the above definition doesn’t make the difference between a forecast and a prediction explicit, Dietze has clarified that there are two types of forecast:

> “A prediction is a”probabilistic statement that something will happen in the future based on what is known today.” … By contrast, a projection is a “probabilistic statement that it is possible that something will happen in the future” conditioned on boundary condition scenarios.”

In other words, a prediction is a ‘best guess’ forecast, and a projection is a ‘what if’ forecast.

## What’s the trouble?

The definition above seems to be reasonably complete. However some issues emerge when we compare this definition to that used by other academics and institutions. For instance, while Beven and Young agree with the EFI on the definition of a projection[^1], their definition of a forecast has a lot more in common with Dietze’s definition of a prediction.

> **Forecasting** is the quantitative reproduction of the behavior of a system ahead of time, but given observations of the inputs, state variables (where applicable), and outputs up to the present time (the forecasting origin).

To make matters worse, according to Beven and Young, the term prediction should be avoided all together due to it’s lack of clear definition.

The IPCC seem to split the difference, defining predictions and forecasts as the same thing

> “A climate **prediction** or climate **forecast** is the result of an attempt to produce (starting from a particular state of the climate system) an estimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the future”. *(IPCC, AR5 Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, Glossary under ‘climate prediction’).*

All of these definitions might be valid if they were consistent, however the shifting usage of these words between authors and between texts undermines the usefulness of having precise scientific terminology.

## How can we unravel this?

Well, for the most part, we can’t. Most fields have their language which is fairly well established. It’s unfortunate that the definitions used by Ecological forecasting are inconsistent with other fields, but at this point it is likely too late to change course.

Instead, what we can do is ensure that ecolgical forecasting itself remains consistent. Furthermore, it is important that terms are defined clearly before they are used.

## Usage throughout the literature

**The Ecological Forecasting Initiative**

The first place we might look is the [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](https://ecoforecast.org/about/) (EFI). The EFI is a grass roots consortium representing ecological forecasters around the world. They recently published some conventions for the publication of ecological forecasts which define ecological forecasting following the definition of Clark et al. (2001)

The Ecological Forecasting Initiative (EFI) have recently published some conventions for the publication of ecological forecasts. While they acknowledge that there are numerous definitions for what constitutes an ecological forecast, they generally follow the usage of Dietze and Clark. In this terminology, the term forecasting includes both predictions (a probabilistic statement of the future (or location or variable) based on what is known today), and projections (a probabilistic statement of the future contingent upon a scenario). Notably, in comparison with the IPCC, forecast and prediction are not synonymous terms.

### The IPCC

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whilst not explicitly an ecological forecasting body, is influential in the forecasting world. Their focus is specifically on longer term climate change, and so their language usage reflects this.

In the parlance of the IPCC, predictions and forecasts are the same thing.

> “A climate **prediction** or climate **forecast** is the result of an attempt to produce (starting from a particular state of the climate system) an estimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the future”. *(IPCC, AR5 Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, Glossary under ‘climate prediction’)*

That is to say, a prediction or forecast is our best guess about what will happen in the future.

A projection, on the other hand, is a statement about the future contingent upon a particular scenario, the likelihood of which is not part of the projection.

> “A **projection** is a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Unlike predictions, projections are conditional on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized.” *(IPCC, Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 deg C, Glossary under ‘Projection’)*

In other words, a projection is a ‘what-if’ forecast.

Note that not just anything can be a scenario. A scenario should be “a plausible description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces (e.g., rate of technological change, prices) and relationships” *(IPCC, Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 deg C, Glossary under ‘Scenario’).*

These definitions are interesting, as they define a forecast and a prediction synonymously. As such, they are perhaps closest to the usage of the terms by the general public, and there is a certain appeal in sidestepping the conflicting definitions all together.

### The Ecological Forecasting Initiative

The Ecological Forecasting Initiative (EFI) have recently published some conventions for the publication of ecological forecasts. While they acknowledge that there are numerous definitions for what constitutes an ecological forecast, they generally follow the usage of Dietze and Clark. In this terminology, the term forecasting includes both predictions (a probabilistic statement of the future (or location or variable) based on what is known today), and projections (a probabilistic statement of the future contingent upon a scenario). Notably, in comparison with the IPCC, forecast and prediction are not synonymous terms.

## Definitions

## Conclusion

At this point, we may well be better off ignoring any distinction between predictions and forecasts. What value we may obtain through precise language is perhaps lost through mismatched understandings.

If the terms prediction and forecast must be used - and often they must - it seems that it is good practice to clearly define them within the text.
