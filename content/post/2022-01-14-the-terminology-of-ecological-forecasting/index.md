## Introduction

There is a great deal of confusion in the ecological forecasting literature about the use of the terms ‘forecasting’ and ‘prediction’. In some articles the terms are used quite loosely, simply to mean ‘a statement about the future’. Other times, they have quite specific definitions.

As a newcomer to the field of ecological forecasting, I’ve found these shifting definitions to be a cause of great confusion. Not only can it make reading a paper more difficult, but also when comparing between papers I’ve found I need to be vigilant in confirming that the language is being used in the same way. One paper’s ‘ecological forecast’ might be another’s ‘environmental simulation’.

This has been particularly troubling in my current attempts to write a review article. How do you review a field when you can’t even find it’s research?

As ecological forecasting is a relatively young field, I think this inconsistent terminology has more impact than simply confusing novice students like me. It serves to create an additional layer of disconnect between authors. How much harder is it to find an article when you don’t know what the key words are?

The good news is, that with one or two notable exceptions, this confusion can be unraveled. By looking at the language used in key ecological forecasting papers, as well as other forecasting domains, we can find a set of definitions which enable effective communication without loss of specificity.

## Usage throughout the literature

### The IPCC

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whilst not explicitly an ecological forecasting body, is influential in the forecasting world. Their focus is specifically on longer term climate change, and so their language usage reflects this.

In the parlance of the IPCC, predictions and forecasts are the same thing.

> “A climate **prediction** or climate **forecast** is the result of an attempt to produce (starting from a particular state of the climate system) an estimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the future”. *(IPCC, AR5 Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, Glossary under ‘climate prediction’)*

That is to say, a prediction or forecast is our best guess about what will happen in the future.

A projection, on the other hand, is a statement about the future contingent upon a particular scenario, the likelihood of which is not part of the projection.

> “A **projection** is a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Unlike predictions, projections are conditional on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized.” *(IPCC, Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 deg C, Glossary under ‘Projection’)*

In other words, a projection is a ‘what-if’ forecast.

Note that not just anything can be a scenario. A scenario should be “a plausible description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces (e.g., rate of technological change, prices) and relationships” *(IPCC, Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 deg C, Glossary under ‘Scenario’).*

These definitions are interesting, as they define a forecast and a prediction synonymously. As such, they are perhaps closest to the usage of the terms by the general public, and there is a certain appeal in sidestepping the conflicting definitions all together.

### The Ecological Forecasting Institute

The Ecological Forecasting Institute (EFI) have recently published some conventions for the publication of ecological forecasts. While they acknowledge that there are numerous definitions for what constitutes an ecological forecast, they generally follow the usage of Dietze and Clark. In this terminology, the term forecasting includes both predictions (a probabilistic statement of the future (or location or variable) based on what is known today), and projections (a probabilistic statement of the future contingent upon a scenario). Notably, in comparison with the IPCC, forecast and prediction are not synonymous terms.

## Novel perspectives

Beven and Young (2013) make the observation that, in addition

## Conclusion

At this point, we may well be better off ignoring any distinction between predictions and forecasts. What value we may obtain through precise language is perhaps lost through mismatched understandings.

If the terms prediction and forecast must be used - and often they must - it seems that it is good practice to clearly define them within the text.
