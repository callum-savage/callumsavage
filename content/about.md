Hi, my name's Callum. I'm a PhD student in the [Fenner School of Environment and Society](https://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/) at the Australian National University.

My research is focused on ecological forecasting.

I am part of the [Institute for Water Futures](https://waterfutures.anu.edu.au/) and the [The Integrated Catchment Assessment and Management Centre (iCAM)](https://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/research/affiliated-research-groups/integrated-catchment-assessment-and-management-centre-icam).
