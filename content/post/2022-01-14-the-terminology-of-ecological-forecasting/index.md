## Introduction

I am currently writing a review article on ecological forecasting, and there's a particular barrier I have come up against, again and again: not only is the concept of ecological forecasting loosely defined as a field, so too are the very terms 'ecological' and 'forecasting'. Sometimes, what I would consider a forecast is referred to as a 'prediction' or 'simulation'. Other times the opposite is true, and what I would consider a 'projection' is referred to as a 'forecast'.

This led me to really consider exactly what I meant when I say ecological forecasting. And I found I didn't have a solid definition. At least, not one that I was confident was shared by at least part of the ecological forecasting community.

Thus this blog post, where I intend to round up some of the (often contradictory) ways in which different researches use the terms 'prediction', 'forecast', and 'projection', amongst others. I hope this might be useful to others entering into this field, who have found themselves as befuddles as I am.

## Usage throughout the literature

### IPCC

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whilst not explicitly an ecological forecasting body, is influential in the forecasting world. Their focus is specifically on longer term climate change, and so their language usage reflects this.

In the parlance of the IPCC, a prediction or forecast is our best assessment of what is likely to happen in the future.

> A **climate prediction** or **climate forecast** is the result of an attempt to produce a most likely description or estimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the future

A projection, on the other hand, is a statement about the future contingent upon a particular scenario, the likelihood of which is not part of the projection.

> \[A **climate projection** is the\] response of the climate system to emission or concentration scenarios of greenhouse gases and aerosols, or radiative forcing scenarios, often based upon simulations by climate models. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions in order to emphasize that climate projections depend upon the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which are based on assumptions, concerning, for example, future socioeconomic and technological developments that may or may not be realized and are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty.

Note that not just anything can be a scenario. A scenario should be based on a "coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces".

These definitions are interesting, as they define a forecast and a prediction synonymously. As such, they are perhaps closest to the usage of the terms by the general public, and there is a certain appeal in sidestepping the conflicting definitions all together.
