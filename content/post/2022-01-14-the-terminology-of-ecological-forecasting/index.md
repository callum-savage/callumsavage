## Introduction

I am currently writing a review article on ecological forecasting, and there’s an unexpected barrier which I have come up against time and time again: what exactly *is* an ecological forecast.

While the ‘ecological’ half of this term is relatively undisputed, the exact definition of a forecast is surprisingly slippery. Different authors use different terminology, and sometimes what I would consider a forecast is referred to as a prediction, or a simulation. In other cases, the opposite is true, and what I would consider a projection is referred to as a forecast.

To be clear, all of these topics may come under the umbrella of ecological forecasting.

This imprecise terminology makes it difficult to find papers on ecological forecasting, and makes comparisons between papers quite dangerous unless you have a firm grasp of how each author is using the language. With this in mind, in this blog post I intend to round up some of the ways in which different researchers use the terms ‘prediction’, ‘forecast’, and ‘projection’, among others. I hope this might be useful to others entering into this field who have found themselves as befuddled as I am.

## Usage throughout the literature

### The IPCC

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whilst not explicitly an ecological forecasting body, is influential in the forecasting world. Their focus is specifically on longer term climate change, and so their language usage reflects this.

In the parlance of the IPCC, predictions and forecasts are the same thing.

> “A climate prediction or climate forecast is the result of an attempt to produce (starting from a particular state of the climate system) an esimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the future”. *(IPCC, AR5 Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, Glossary under ‘climate prediction’)*

A projection, on the other hand, is a statement about the future contingent upon a particular scenario, the likelihood of which is not part of the projection.

> “A **projection** is a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Unlike predictions, projections are conditional on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized.” *(IPCC, Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 deg C, Glossary under ‘Projection’)*

Note that not just anything can be a scenario. A scenario should be “a plausible description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces (e.g., rate of technological change, prices) and relationships” *(IPCC, Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 deg C, Glossary under ‘Scenario’).*

These definitions are interesting, as they define a forecast and a prediction synonymously. As such, they are perhaps closest to the usage of the terms by the general public, and there is a certain appeal in sidestepping the conflicting definitions all together.

### The Ecological Forecasting Institute

The Ecological Forecasting Institute (EFI) have recently published some conventions for the publication of ecological forecasts. While they acknowledge that there are numerous definitions for what constitutes an ecological forecast, they generally follow the usage of Dietze and Clark. In this terminology, the term forecasting includes both predictions (a probabilistic statement of the future (or location or variable) based on what is known today), and projections (a probabilistic statement of the future contingent upon a scenario). Notably, in comparison with the IPCC, forecast and prediction are not synonymous terms.

## Novel perspectives

## Conclusion

At this point, we may well be better off ignoring any distinction between predictions and forecasts. What value we may obtain through precise language is perhaps lost through mismatched understandings.
